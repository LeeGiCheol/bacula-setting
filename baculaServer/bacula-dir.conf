# Default Bacula Director Configuration file

#  The only thing that MUST be changed is to add one or more
#   file or directory names in the Include directive of the
#   FileSet resource.

#  For Bacula release 7.0.5 (28 July 2014) -- redhat Enterprise release
#
#  You might also want to change the default email address
